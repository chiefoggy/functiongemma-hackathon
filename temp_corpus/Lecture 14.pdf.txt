Example 4.1.4.2  Question
Find a basis for the row space and a basis for the column space of  A.Hence state the dimension of the row space and the dimension of the column space of  A.(In the following, we solve the problem based on some observations.  In Remark 4.1.9 and Remark 4.1.13, we shall have systematic methods for solving problems of this type.)

Remark on Example 4.1.4.2In Example 4.1.4.2, both the row space and the column space of  Aare  3.In general, the row space and the column space of a matrix alwayshave the same dimension.  The details will be discussed in Theorem 4.2.1.
As in Notation 3.1.5, we can identify an n-vector  (u1, u2 , …, un) with a  1 xnmatrix  (u1u2 … un)  (row vectors) 
÷÷÷÷÷øöçççççèænuuu!21or an  nx1matrix             (column vector).
Notation 4.1.5
From now on, to make the context clear, when a vector in Rnis written as (u1, u2 , …, un) it is a row vector and is identified with the 1 xnmatrix as      (u1u2 … un)  (row vectors) ; and if it is written as (u1, u2 , …, un)T, it is a column vector and is identified with the nx1matrix (column vector).
Discussion 4.1.6In Definition 1.2.4, we say that two matrices  Aand  Bare row equivalentif one can be obtained from the other by a series of elementary row operations.Using the concept of row equivalent matrices, we shall develop methods to find bases for row spaces and column spaces.
Discussion 4.1.6The notion of row equivalent is an equivalence relationon matrices of the same size:(a)Reflexive:Any matrix is row equivalent to itself.(b)Symmetric:If a matrix  Ais row equivalent to a matrix  B,  then  Bis also row equivalent to  A.(c)Transitive:If a matrix  Ais row equivalent to a matrix  Band  Bis row equivalent to a matrix  C,  then  Ais also row equivalent to  C.
Discussion 4.1.6A matrix is row equivalent to its row-echelon form.In particular, if two matrices  Aand  Bhave a same row-echelon form or the same reduced row-echelon form, then  Aand  Bare row equivalent.
Theorem 4.1.7Let  Aand  Bbe row equivalent matrices.The row space of  Aand the row space of  Bare identical.i.e. elementary row operations preservethe row space of a matrix.
Exercise 4.1.7Prove Theorem 4.1.7by showing that each of the three types of elementary row operations preserves the row space of a matrix.
Example 4.1.8.1
The four matrices  A, B, C, Dare row equivalent to one another and hence they all have the same row space.

Remark 4.1.9Let  Abe a matrix and  Ra row-echelon form of  A.Then the set of nonzero rows of  Ris a basis for the row space of  A.
Discussion 4.1.10Since the column space of a matrix  Ais the row space of  AT,  a basis for column space of  Acan be obtained from a row-echelon form of  AT.However, we shall study another method for finding a basis for the column space of  Abased on the information obtained from a row-echelon form of  A.
Discussion 4.1.10Before we discuss the method, we must aware that elementary row operations may not preserve the column space of a matrix.i.e. two row equivalent matrices may have differentcolumn spaces.

Theorem 4.1.11Let  Aand  Bbe row equivalent matrices.1.A given set of columns of  Ais linearly independent if and only if the set of corresponding columns of  Bis linearly independent.2.A given set of columns of  Aform a basis for the column space of  Aif and only if the set of corresponding columns of  Bform a basis for the column space of  B.The proof of the theorem is left as an exercise. See Question 4.18.
