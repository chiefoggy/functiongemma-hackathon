Part I –Lab Sessions/QuizSNo formal class structure
SOn lab session weeks, go to S17-03-02 anytime during the following designated time slots to complete your worksheet.SMonday 8am-10am; Tuesday 1pm-3pmSWednesday 1pm-4pm; Thursday 12pm-2pm and 4pm-5pmSFriday 12pm-1pmSOnce you have completed your worksheet, you can leave the lab. No attendance will be taken.
SDuring the above time slots, there will be a lab assistant to assist you if necessary.SIf you are unable to go to the lab during the above time slots, you may still complete your worksheet in the lab at any other time convenient to you. However, there will not be any lab assistant present.SAvailability of  computers is on a first-come-first-served basis. SYou do not need to go to the lab at the same time ever y week.SThere will be formal class structure for the lab quiz in week 13. More details later.

The Chicken-Rabbits Problem
Now there are pheasants and rabbits in the same cage. The top [of the cage] has 35 heads and the bottom has 94 legs.Find the number of pheasants and rabbits.
Linear Equations
Unknown variables:•x: the number of pheasants;•y: thenumberof rabbits.
•35 heads:
•94 legs:
x+y=35
2x+4y=94

Part II –About Linear Algebra 
SWhat is Linear Algebra?SLinear = having the properties of lines (线性代数)S1 dimensional linear object = lineS2 dimensional linear object = plane
SLinear Algebra is the study of mathematical objects and properties that are related to lines, planes and their generalization.
Part II –What is it for? 
SThe techniques and concepts are useful in solving problems in many areas:SMathematics (Math trench)SPhysics (Circuit)SStatistics (Linear regression)SChemistry (Balancing chemical Eq.)SComputer Science (Alpha GO)SEngineeringSEconomics, and many more
