The	Chickens-and-Rabbits	Problem	
Now there are pheasants 
and rabbits in the same 
cage.  
The top [of the cage] has 
35 heads and the bottom 
has 94 legs. 
 
Find the number of 
pheasants and rabbits. 
Linear	equations	
Unknown variables:  
• x : the number of pheasants; 
• y : the number of  rabbits.   
 
35 heads:     x + y = 35 
94 legs:     2x + 4y = 94 
 
In general, these two equations are of the same kind                
ax + by = c 
where  a  and  b  are not both zero. 
Discussion	1.1.1	
A line in the  xy-plane can be represented 
algebraically by an equation of the form 
ax + by = c 
where  a  and  b  are not both zero. 
An Equation of this kind is known as a linear 
equation in the variable of  x  and  y. 
Definition	1.1.2	Linear	Equation	
A linear equation in  n  variables  x1, x2, …, xn  has 
the form 
a1x1 + a2x2 + ··· + anxn = b 
where  a1, a2, …, an  and  b  are real constants. 
The variables in a linear equation are also called the 
unknowns.  
The constants a1, a2, …, an are also called the 
coefficients.  
Example	1.1.3		Linear	Equations	
In each part, determine whether the following 
equations are linear or not.  
  xy=1  2x+y=πYes 
  y=−7x+3z−1No

Yes 
No 
   x1+x2+!+xn=1  y=tanx+lnz+1
Example	1.1.3	
The linear equation  ax + by + cz = d,  where  a, b, c, 
d  are constants and not all  a, b, c  are zero, 
represents a plane in the three dimensional space. 
For example  z = 0  (i.e.  0x + 0y + z = 0)  is the  xy-
plane contained inside the three dimensional space. 
          z 
 
 
                                x

Definition	1.1.4	(Solution)	
Given  n  real numbers  s1, s2, …, sn,  we say that 
x1 = s1,  x2 = s2,  …,  xn = sn  is a solution of a linear 
equation  a1x1 + a2x2 + ··· + anxn = b  if the equation 
is satisfied when we substitute the values into the 
equation accordingly. 
 
That is, 
a1s1+a2s2!+ansn=b
Definition	1.1.4	(Solution	set	and	general	solution)	
The set of all solutions of the equation is called the 
solution set of the equation. 
An expression that give us all these solutions is 
called the general solution of the equation. 
Example 1.1.5 (1) General solution 
Consider the linear equation  2x + 4y = 94. 
The general solution is 
where  t  is an arbitrary parameter.   x=ty=472−t2⎧⎨⎪⎩⎪We can also write the general solution as 
 
where  s  is an arbitrary parameter.   x=47−2sy=s⎧⎨⎪⎩⎪These include all solutions such as 
 
and infinitely many solutions.   x=1y=23⎧⎨⎪⎩⎪x=2y=22.5⎧⎨⎪⎩⎪x=−1.6y=24.3⎧⎨⎪⎩⎪
Example	1.1.5	3(a)	Geometric	interpretation	
In the  xy-plane, the solutions of the equation 
x + y = 35  are  (x, y) = (35 – s, s)  for  s  in  R. 
 y                                       x                    x + y = 35  
  (35−s,s)
Example	1.1.5	3(b)	
In the three dimensional space, the solutions of  
x + y = 1  (i.e.  x + y + 0z = 1)  are  
(x, y, z) = (1 – s, s, t)  for  s, t  in  R. 
                 z  x + y = 1                                                      y       x

Definition	1.1.6	Linear	system	
A finite set of linear equations in the variables  x1, x2, 
…, xn  is called a system of linear equations (or a 
linear system): 
 
 
 
 
 
where  a11, a12, …, amn  and  b1, b2, …, bm  are real 
constants.

Definition	1.1.6	Solution	set	
Given  n  real numbers  s1, s2, …, sn,  we say that  
x1 = s1,  x2 = s2,  …,  xn = sn  is a solution of the 
system if  x1 = s1,  x2 = s2,  …,  xn = sn  is a solution 
of every equation in the system. 
The set of all solutions of the system is called the 
solution set of the system and an expression that give 
us all these solutions is called the general solution of 
the system.

We can represent the system by a rectangular array 
of numbers: 
This array is called the augmented matrix of the 
system.

Definition	1.2.6	
Two augmented matrices are said to be row 
equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a 
series of elementary row operations. 
Theorem	1.2.7	
If augmented matrices of two systems of linear 
equations are row equivalent, then the two systems 
have the same set of solutions.

Example	1.2.5	
All augmented matrices in Example 1.2.5 are row 
equivalent. 
All systems of linear equations in Example 1.2.5 
have the same solution. 
Exercise			
To see why Theorem 1.2.7 is true, we only need to 
check that every elementary row operation applied to 
an augmented matrix will not change the solution set 
of the corresponding linear system. 
It is obvious that the solution set will not be changed 
by operations 1 and 2 in Discussion 1.2.3. 
Show that the solution set of a linear system will not 
be changed by operation 3 in Discussion 1.2.3. 
Definition	1.3.1		Row-echelon

form if it has the following properties:
