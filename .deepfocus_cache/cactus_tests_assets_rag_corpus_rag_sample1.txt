Cactus Compute Inc: Pioneering On-Device AI Infrastructure

Cactus Compute Inc (often referred to simply as Cactus) is an emerging technology startup focused on advancing edge artificial intelligence—that is, enabling powerful AI capabilities directly on mobile and wearable devices rather than in the cloud. It represents a new wave of infrastructure companies aiming to solve some of the key limitations of traditional cloud-based AI, such as latency, privacy, and cost.

Core Vision and Technology

The central offering from Cactus is an open-source software development kit (SDK) and inference engine that allows developers to run large language models (LLMs), vision, and speech models directly on devices like smartphones and wearables. This approach dramatically reduces dependence on cloud servers, which can introduce higher latency and raise privacy concerns because data must be transmitted over the internet. Instead, Cactus optimizes AI to run locally—leading to faster responses, improved privacy, and lower operating costs.

Cactus achieves this through hardware-aware kernels and optimized inference pipelines that work across platforms including iOS and Android, as well as support for popular developer frameworks like Flutter, React Native, and Kotlin. The company’s SDK is designed to be cross-platform and compatible with a wide range of AI models from repositories such as Hugging Face, allowing developers to integrate multimodal AI (text, vision, speech) into apps that function offline.

Founders and Funding

Cactus was launched in 2025 and has quickly gained attention in the AI infrastructure space, even being featured in Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 cohort, a sign of early credibility and startup acceleration support.

The co-founders Henry Ndubuaku and Roman Shemet bring complementary expertise in AI/ML and finance. Ndubuaku notably chose to focus on Cactus instead of pursuing a research role at Nvidia, highlighting the startup’s emphasis on practical on-device AI engineering.

Cactus has also attracted investment from early-stage backers like Antigravity Capital, which sees the company’s SDK as a potential “standard layer” for edge AI akin to how CUDA became fundamental for GPU computing.

Use Cases and Impact

The on-device AI enabled by Cactus supports numerous practical use cases:

Mobile Applications: Real-time AI assistants that work without an internet connection.

Privacy-Sensitive Apps: Healthcare or financial tools where user data must remain local.

Low-Connectivity Environments: Regions or scenarios with limited network access.

Cost-Efficient Operations: Companies can significantly reduce cloud computing costs by shifting inference to user devices.

Early adoption indicators show Cactus’s framework being used in hundreds of developer projects and products, suggesting traction within the developer community who are building the next generation of edge AI experiences.

Broader Significance

If successful, Cactus could redefine how AI is integrated into everyday devices—creating experiences that are faster, more private, and less reliant on centralized cloud infrastructure. By providing a cross-platform, open basis for running AI workloads locally, Cactus stands at the intersection of AI, mobile computing, and developer empowerment, positioning itself as a foundational platform for the emerging edge AI era.
